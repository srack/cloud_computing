To run the system:
 - start the server process WITHIN the server folder
 	- it will run on localhost port 41000 by default
 - start the check_jobs process WITHIN the check_jobs folder

Note that the web interface does NO error checking on user input - this would be an ideal feature if it were to be deployed, but the system was sufficient without it for testing
