	<h3> Part 2 - One Minute Video Generation Using Condor </h4>

		For each resolution of video, the log files indicated that all of the jobs were 
		submitted immediately at the call of condor_submit. This finding is interesting since 
		other example log analyses showed that jobs are submitted over time. This could be because
		the overhead for setting up each of the jobs on Condor was relatively low; only two small
		files had to be transferred so each of the submissions could be done quickly. <br> <br>
		In the 320x400 resolution video, the log analysis indicates that about half of the ten minutes 
		required for the jobs to complete was waiting time after they were submitted. After the first 
		job was running, many more followed, and the peak number running was about 450. <br> <br>
		With each of the other higher resolution video rendering jobs, the same trend is observed. 
		The jobs begin running relatively quickly after submission, but after most of the jobs have 
		completed, there is a large proportion of the total time that was needed to complete the final
		few jobs. This trend is likely because each of the higher resolution jobs required much more
		computation than the 320x400 renderings, thus jobs that were evicted while running would required
		that time shown at the end of the log analysis graph. <br> <br>
		In general, the jobs ran smoothly and without any unusual results (other than the lengthy tail of
		the final few jobs finishing). I ran most of my jobs early in the morning when Condor was not largely
		in use, so I think this contributed to allowing the jobs to run as expected.
